This blog was under reconstruction several months. Mostly because of a lot of things happened and I had no time to do all necessary reorganisation work related to the blog. Eventually I decided to reborn and migrate from [Orchard CMS][orchard] to [Github Pages][gp] with Jekyll. Rise my blog in shape of Octophoenix now! 

Orchard CMS is excelent opensource content management system from Microsoft. This CMS is good example how to build flexible and extensible software using ASP.NET MVC and C#, full of best practicies, design patterns and interesting solutions. I learnt a lot investigating source code of Orchard CMS. This blog was based on Orchard CMS quite a long time. All posts until this one has been written using Orchard. But since I have been started I thought that I don't need all these features for blogging and I feel lack of some features like simple and straightforward version control 



1. I use [jekyllbootstrap][jb], but anyway I had to spent quite a lot of time to fix and customize everyting for myself.

2. I changed lifeecho theme to support of mobile devices. This support is based on [Skeleton CSS framework][skeleton].  

3. For syntax highlighting I use Rouge and found CSS for this [here][css]
